1. Why do we need CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)?
Ans : every browser has a security feature called the `same-origin policy` 
      that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain
      than the one that served the web page. This is done to prevent 
      malicious websites from accessing sensitive data on other domains 
      without permission.


2. cors (Cross origin resource sharing): 
        - It is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how resources on a web server can be requested from another domain. 
        - It's a crucial mechanism for managing `cross-origin` requests and ensuring secure interactions between `different origins` on the web.
        - cors is used to connect the frontend and backend which had different url/domain but if the backend and the frontend is deployed in the
        - same domain then this cors is not required.
